Problem 5
Block Chain

while I implemented the block chain with some additional methods like search,remove, insert, and append which all have O(n) Complexity,
it is still possible to create a block chain using the prepend method in O(1) and also remove blocks
using the pop method in O(1)

Time Complexity: O(1) for append and pop
Space Complexity : O(n)
