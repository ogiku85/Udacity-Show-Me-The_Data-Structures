Problem 6
Union and Intersection

In both union and intersect methods I used a set to ensure there were no duplicates in the final result. 
In the case of union, the set served to ensure that if both list contained the same value e.g 2, only one of this will be printed.
In the case of intersection it was used to ensure that only items that existed in both list were added to the final result by providing a constant lookup while
traversing the second list. If the value existed in the set and the second list then it was added to the intersection result.

Time Complexity : O(n + m) - Both list had to be traversed. n is size of list 1 and m is size of list 2.
Space Complexity: O(n + m) - The space consumed by both list. n is size of list 1 and m is size of list 2.
