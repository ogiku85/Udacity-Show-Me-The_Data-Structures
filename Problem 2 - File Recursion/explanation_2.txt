Problem 2
File Recursion

In this I recursively check every directory and inspect the file name looking for a match with the specified suffix.

Time Complexity : O(nd) - n is the number of directories and d is the number of sub directories
Space Complexity : O(n + l) n is the size of the result list ie found files and l is the size of the list of the current directory
